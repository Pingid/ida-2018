I try to cultivate my own garden based on metaphor of garden, and situating between essence and phenomenon of it with found memories, real life experience, literary and myth. This is a study of garden related to human condition by visiting mine and other peopleâ€™s experience and memories in different time and space. It's a jouney of learning a way of being and seeing things under the image again, and walking out from garden of Eden to garden of real life in this era. The garden triggers me to start this journey, while it also greets me, and derives more from me. Slowing down you pace and give the space a time to echo, repercussion, and mirror your mind here.","projectType/materials":"museum set up displaying collection with transformed photograph sculpture, found objects,  archives, walking and mapping experience  ","socialMedia/websiteLinks":"instagram: chipsandyogurt                 http://cargocollective.com/chipsandyogurt",mapCoOrdinates:"(-23, 70)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Tianyi Liu>Tiyani.gif",slug:"tianyi-liu",coordinates:{x:.385,y:.85}}}}});
