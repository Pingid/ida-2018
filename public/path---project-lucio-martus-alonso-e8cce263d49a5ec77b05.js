In this installation I aim to showcase the data I have been recording for the last three years of my degree. With this, visitors are invited to explore my experience and my adaptation into independance in an interactive and visual experience. Each piece represents a payment made, which all together create a visual scale of where the money went. And with each graph showing different aspects of consumption, people will be able to see where  the money went and how I spent it.","projectType/materials":"Screen-based Installation","socialMedia/websiteLinks":"https://www.behance.net/lumartus950a3f, Instagram/Twitter: @luciomartus",mapCoOrdinates:"(100, 67)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Lucio Martus Alonso>Lucio.gif",gifs:"Lucio.gif",slug:"lucio-martus-alonso",coordinates:{x:1,y:.835}}}}});
