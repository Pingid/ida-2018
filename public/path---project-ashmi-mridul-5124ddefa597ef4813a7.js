Camera obscuras are room-sized pinhole cameras, created by completely blacking out a room, leaving just a small hole for light to seep in and create an image on the walls. The viewers are surrounded by a spectacular visual which brings the outside inside. The project came out of my personal desire to share this experience with friends and family around the world. I sent out kits with materials and instructions for them to construct their own cameras. Inside this box, are images of different locations, captured in varied confined spaces by all the community members. Peep in, to get a glimpse of the world from their eyes!
