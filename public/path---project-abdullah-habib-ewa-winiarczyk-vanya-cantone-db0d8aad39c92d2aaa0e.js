This has met with multiple protests, in response to a number of issues, such as the scarcity of affordable social housing proposed. This project deploys ethnographic methods to give voice to the individuals born, raised and working around the shopping centre. It alludes to the verticality of architectural changes and collective memories connected to the site-specific locations. Vertical takes the form of a film, and is accompanied by sculptures moulded from fragments of the soon-to-be-demolished buildings that surround the shopping centre. Vertical was made with the great help of local participants.\n","projectType/materials":"Screen-based Installation",mapCoOrdinates:"(90, 50)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Abdullah Habib, Ewa Winiarczyk, Vanya Cantone>Abdullah and Co.gif",slug:"abdullah-habib-ewa-winiarczyk-vanya-cantone",coordinates:{x:.95,y:.75}}}}});
