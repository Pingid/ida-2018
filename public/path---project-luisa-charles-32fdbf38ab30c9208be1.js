It is made up of a series of interactive kinetic sculptures: each sculpture has an output that affects the next sculptureâ€™s behaviour, which creates a chain reaction that builds up, leaving a self-sustaining ecosystem of inorganic organisms living in a state of symbiosis. The sculptures are based on natural traits observed in the animal and plant kingdoms, investigating where the given affordances of everyday objects converge with organic behaviours. This ultimately forms a design fiction, aiming to provide an answer to the question: What if objects evolved to exist in the form that they do, rather than having been designed?","projectType/materials":"Mixed Media Kinetic Sculptures","socialMedia/websiteLinks":"www.luisacharles.com",mapCoOrdinates:"(-70, -60)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Luisa Charles>Luisa.gif",gifs:"Luisa.gif",slug:"luisa-charles",coordinates:{x:.15,y:.2}}}}});
