Every window represents a moment of my life. From the giving of the baby to the new mother to be, to identity questioning when growing up, to a 21-year-old who found her birth parents. The imagery was inspired by Kara Walker.  Womb is a magical and emotional piece to retrace a moment and a story.","projectType/materials":"Light-driven Acrylic Sculpture",mapCoOrdinates:"(76, -100)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Lou-Anne Le Mener>Lou.gif",gifs:"Lou.gif",slug:"lou-anne-le-mener",coordinates:{x:.88,y:0}}}}});
