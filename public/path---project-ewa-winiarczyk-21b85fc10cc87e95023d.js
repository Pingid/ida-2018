The air pollution in small towns is not caused by industrialisation, but rather human activity: burning household trash, which ranges from rubber to plastic. This project tackles the issue in a site-specific way, focusing on an off-season spa town Busko-ZdrÃ³j, which reaches deadly pollution levels every year. It aims to temporarily shift the power of religion - from being connected with constant human rights violation (especially in the context of rigorous abortion laws) to a social change catalyst. The process involves a letter sent to Pope Francis, smog detecting religious artefacts and local participation, among others.","projectType/materials":"audio installation (with headphones)",mapCoOrdinates:"(-20, 75)",imagePaths:"My Drive>Degree Show 2018>Website Assets>Ewa Winiarczyk>Ewa.gif",gifs:"Ewa.gif",slug:"ewa-winiarczyk",coordinates:{x:.4,y:.875}}}}});
